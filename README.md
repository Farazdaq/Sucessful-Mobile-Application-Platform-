# Sucessful-Mobile-Application-Platform-

             Successful mobile applications platform (SMAP) is web base mobile applications platform which integrates mobile apps developers across the globe and their prospect users and help them to communicate using one standard language. However, it helps the developers to predict the success of their new under-development app and interact with users meanwhile the development process. On one hand the usage of artificial intelligent and machine learning improve the management of large data and build smart software. On the other hand data mining enhance our chances to extract knowledge form large data. Therefore to get the way through the complexity of mobile apps market and it’s raped change SMAP is very necessary, helpful and competitive alternative for Google play, Apkpure. For it’s usage of artificial intelligence, machine learning to predict the features of a successful app then add more wanted features and describe them in a standard way, link these features to one ultimate goal and vision, creating a roadmap to guide the developing process and managing users, developers interactions.                
       The scope of this software:
•	Predicting the success of a new developed mobile application. 
•	Connecting the developer with the possible stakeholders or the end user.  
•	Maintaining a global integrated database for software engineers for useful development information.
•	Creating a roadmap for the new developed app. 
•	Managing the developer projects information.
•	Managing the users’ reviews and requests. Increase
